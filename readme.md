# SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of object-oriented design principles that aim to help create clean and maintainable code. They were created by Robert C. Martin and consist of five principles:

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
This principle states that each class should have a single responsibility and that responsibility should be well-defined. This means that each class should have only one reason to change.

## Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
This principle states that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality to your classes without having to modify them.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
This principle states that child classes should be substitutable for parent classes without affecting program correctness. This means that you should be able to use a child class in place of a parent class without causing problems.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
This principle states that interfaces should be specific to the needs of the classes that implement them. This means that you should avoid generic interfaces that force classes to implement methods that they don't need.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

This principle states that classes should depend on abstractions and not on concrete implementations. This means that you should avoid depending on specific classes and instead depend on interfaces or abstractions.

By following these principles, you can develop cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable code.
